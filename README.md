### Leverage and Spread - Xinye 
The effect of future leverage is large, generally exceeding the effect of contemporaneous leverage to predict spread.

To investigate leverage prediction by investors, we construct 3 proxies for leverage changes, based on 3 theoretical perspectives on firm capital structure:
1. LEV, (a vector of firm characteristics: lots of financial statement data) relies on the trade-off theory, 
2. FINDEFA, (cash dividends, net investment, working capital, net cash flow) relies on the pecking order theory, 
3. Dummy variable CRPOM: firms with a “plus or minus” credit rating (CRPOM = 1) more frequently choose equity over debt financing, ceteris paribus.derives from Kisgen’s (2006) hypothesis that firms close to the next higher rating (e.g., BBB+ is close to A–) prefer to avoid issuing new debt.

a vector of firm characteristics: 
EBIT TA is earnings before interest and taxes scaled by total assets, MB is the ratio of market-to-book value of assets, DEP TA is depreciation expense to total assets, lnTA is the natural log of total assets, FA TA is the ratio of fixed-to-total assets, R&D DUM is an indicator variable for whether the firm reports an R&D expenditure or not, R&D TA is R&D expenditures scaled by total assets, RATED is an indicator for whether the firm has rated debt, and IND MED is the median leverage for each firm’s industry.

data: on the quarterly accounting data,
