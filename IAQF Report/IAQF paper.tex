\section*{Abstract}

Super-resolution microscopy has become essential for the study of
nanoscale biological processes. This type of imaging often requires
the use of specialised image analysis tools to process a large volume
of recorded data and extract quantitative information. In recent years,
our team has built an open-source image analysis framework for super-resolution
microscopy designed to combine high performance and ease of use.
